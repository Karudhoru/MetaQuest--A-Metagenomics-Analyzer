# MetaQuest

A comprehensive metagenomics analysis pipeline for taxonomic classification, pathogen detection, and functional annotation of microbial communities.

## Overview

MetaQuest is an integrated bioinformatics pipeline that addresses the complex challenges of metagenomic data analysis. By combining state-of-the-art tools and databases, MetaQuest provides researchers with a streamlined workflow for understanding microbial community composition, identifying potential pathogens, and assessing antimicrobial resistance profiles from sequencing data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status

**MetaQuest is currently under active development.** The core functionality is operational with significant improvements in FASTA processing capabilities:

### Current FASTA Processing Status
- **Taxonomic Classification**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - FASTA taxonomic profiling is now accurate and fully functional
- **Pathogenicity Assessment**: üîÑ **IN DEVELOPMENT** - Pathogen detection workflows for FASTA inputs require optimization
- **Virulence Factor Analysis**: üîÑ **IN DEVELOPMENT** - Virulence factor identification from FASTA files needs refinement
- **AMR Analysis**: üîÑ **IN DEVELOPMENT** - Antimicrobial resistance detection for FASTA inputs under active development

**Current Status**: FASTA files now provide reliable taxonomic classification. Pathogen screening, AMR analysis, and virulence factor detection are functional but undergoing optimization for improved accuracy.

### Development Timeline
