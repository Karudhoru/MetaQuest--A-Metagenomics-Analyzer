# Database management

MetaQuest keeps reference data outside the Python package and records the exact
database release used by an analysis.

## Available profiles

| Key | Database | Release | Download | Installed | Status |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `taxonomy` | Kraken2 Standard-8 with Bracken | 2026-06-26 | ~5.5 GB | ~7.5–8.1 GB | available |
| `functional` | eggNOG-mapper core data | 5.0.2 | ~11.3 GB | ~53 GB | available |
| `amr` | AMRFinderPlus candidate | — | — | — | planned |
| `virulence` | VFDB Set A candidate | — | — | — | planned |

The taxonomy archive comes from the official Kraken2 index catalog:
<https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2>.

Planned entries are visible so users can understand the intended layout, but
MetaQuest refuses to install them until their versions and validation contracts
are finalized. The functional profile installs eggNOG annotation, taxonomy, and
DIAMOND data only; it excludes Pfam, MMseqs, HMM, and novel-family data.

## Inspect status

~~~bash
metaquest databases --db-dir /data/metaquest-db --list
~~~

Example:

~~~text
taxonomy: installed | 2026-06-26 | 5.5 GB download / 7.5 GB installed
functional: available | 5.0.2 | 11.3 GB download / 53 GB installed
amr: planned | pending | not finalized
virulence: planned | pending | not finalized
~~~

## Install taxonomy

~~~bash
metaquest databases \
  --db-dir /data/metaquest-db \
  --database taxonomy
~~~

The installer:

1. resolves and creates the database root;
2. checks free disk space;
3. downloads the upstream checksum list;
4. downloads or resumes the archive;
5. selects the checksum matching the archive filename;
6. verifies the complete archive;
7. rejects unsafe archive paths and links;
8. extracts into a temporary directory;
9. verifies required Kraken2 index files;
10. writes `metaquest-db.json`;
11. atomically publishes `taxonomy/`;
12. removes the completed download cache.

An existing valid installation is reused. An invalid directory is never
silently overwritten; replacement requires `--force`.

## Install functional data

~~~bash
metaquest databases \
  --db-dir /data/metaquest-db \
  --database functional
~~~

The functional installer keeps resumable partial files under
`.downloads/functional/`, checks the official compressed byte sizes, records a
local SHA-256 for each artifact, and validates both SQLite files plus the
DIAMOND database before publishing the installation. Partial files are retained
after a failure and removed only after a successful install.

This checkpoint makes eggNOG 5.0.2 installation reproducible. The current
pipeline is not yet integrated with eggNOG-mapper and stops after Pyrodigal
gene prediction.

## Manifest

`metaquest-db.json` records:

- MetaQuest database key and descriptive name;
- upstream release;
- source URL;
- download and installed-size estimates;
- installation timestamp;
- upstream artifact URL and compressed byte size;
- verified taxonomy archive MD5 or local functional-artifact SHA-256.

MD5 is used because it is the checksum published by the upstream index catalog.
It protects transfer integrity; it is not treated as a cryptographic signature.

## Path resolution

MetaQuest resolves the root in this order:

1. command-level `--db-dir`;
2. `METAQUEST_DB_DIR`;
3. `databases.base_dir` in the selected YAML file;
4. `./databases`.

The taxonomy index defaults to `ROOT/taxonomy`.

## External disk with a repository-local path

~~~bash
mkdir -p /mnt/e/metaquest/databases
ln -s /mnt/e/metaquest/databases databases
metaquest databases --database taxonomy
~~~

The repository ignores `/databases`, including this symlink.

## Updating a release

Database releases are pinned in source so analyses remain reproducible.
Changing a release requires:

- updating the catalog entry and expected size;
- adding or updating checksum/parser tests;
- verifying Kraken2 and all bundled Bracken read lengths;
- recording the change in the changelog;
- rerunning benchmark datasets before making the new release the default.
